# GitHub Setup and Deployment Instructions

## 🚀 Ready to Push to GitHub!

Your MDCAN BDM 2025 Certificate Generator is now built and ready for GitHub. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `mdcan-bdm-2025-certificate` (or your preferred name)
5. Description: `Professional certificate generator for MDCAN BDM 2025 conference`
6. Set to **Public** (recommended) or Private
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Copy the repository URL from GitHub (should look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mdcan-bdm-2025-certificate.git`)

Then run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mdcan-bdm-2025-certificate.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional - for live demo)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select branch: **`master`** or **`main`**
6. Select folder: **`/ (root)`**
7. Click "Save"

**Note**: For React apps, you might need to set up a deployment workflow. Consider using:
- **Netlify** (recommended): Drag and drop the `build` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository
- **GitHub Pages with deployment action**
